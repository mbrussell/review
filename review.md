General comments:
-

This is a good paper. I especially liked the following things:

* ABC
* DEF
* GHI

I think these aspects can be improved:

1. CBA
2. FED
3. IHG

Here are a few comments where I _emphasize_ a couple of __things__.

* page x, line x: You might think about what Poe said:

> "Quote the raven, nevermore."

* page x, line x: You analyzed the data like this:

```{r}
2+2=5
```

I would have analyzed the data like this:

```{r}
2+2=4
```
* Did you do a search on [google](http://www.google.com)?

* page x, line x: Did you try the `nlme` function on your data?

* A few other things to consider:

Section | Fix
------------- | -------------
__Abstract__      | Make it shorter.
__Discussion__    | Add a citation to my paper.
